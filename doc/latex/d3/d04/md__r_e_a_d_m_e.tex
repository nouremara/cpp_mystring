Implementation of Own String Class

In this presents an implementation of a class named {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classutil_1_1string}{util\+::string}}}. This class behavior is similar to the {\ttfamily std\+::string} and both {\ttfamily std\+::string} and this {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classutil_1_1string}{util\+::string}}} class are compatible. \end{quote}
Full and detailed examples of uses and tests of the class {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classutil_1_1string}{util\+::string}}} are given in the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{main_8cpp}{main.\+cpp}}} file. Each method and operator is very carefully tested (e.\+g., concatenating different strings, ..., etc).

An example test run is shown in the following screenshot\+:



Note that the {\bfseries{terminal output is colored}} (using \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code}{\texttt{ ANSI escape codes}}) for better visibility.

{\bfseries{Doxygen}} generated documentation (in html and La\+TeX formats) can be found at \href{doc/html/index.html}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily doc/html/index.\+html}}} and \href{doc/latex/refman.pdf}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily doc/latex/refman.\+pdf}}}, respectively. The configuration file {\ttfamily Doxyfile} is used with the Doxygen generation tool.

The following design and implementation criteria are followed\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{No C/\+C++ standard functions or classes are used}} to realize {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classutil_1_1string}{util\+::string}}} class. This include, e.\+g., {\ttfamily strcmp}, {\ttfamily strlen} and of course using {\ttfamily std\+::string} as an internal representation of {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classutil_1_1string}{util\+::string}}}.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This means own functions/methods are developed and implemented to calculate the length of a {\ttfamily char$\ast$}, to compare character sequences or to copy them full or partially.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item For now, {\bfseries{no error handling}} (e.\+g., accessing an invalid index by using operator \mbox{[}\mbox{]}) is implemented. This may be done later.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Use this class at your own risk}} \+:).
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The code follows \href{https://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html}{\texttt{ LLVM Coding Standards}}.
\item The {\itshape \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case}{\texttt{ sanke\+\_\+case}}} naming convention is used for variable and function names (with few exceptions).
\item {\bfseries{Use this class at your own risk}} \+:).

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The class {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classutil_1_1string}{util\+::string}}} is implemented inside the two files {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{utilstring_8cpp}{utilstring.\+cpp}}} and {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{utilstring_8h}{utilstring.\+h}}}
\item Class string is within the namespace {\ttfamily util}
\item The memory management is done by using a pointer ({\ttfamily internal\+\_\+buffer}) pointing to the data type char. {\ttfamily char$\ast$} are (normally) null terminated. This means, that the last character is always a {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}0} (NULL character) which marks the end of a char sequence. This character is never printed as it just allows for detecting whether the end of a char sequence has been reached. The string is always null-\/terminate (internally!)
\item Initially, the class provides memory for 10 printable characters. Note that this default value is provided by the constant {\ttfamily INITIAL\+\_\+\+SIZE} (defined at the top of {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{utilstring_8h}{utilstring.\+h}}}). It can be changed if another value is desired.
\item A relatively simple concept is designed and implemented to extend the internal memory if {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classutil_1_1string}{util\+::string}}} has to store more than 10 characters.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{Constructors}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}
The following constructors are implemented\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily string()} \+: Default constructor with empty initialization
\item {\ttfamily string(size\+\_\+t intial\+Size)} \+: constructor with parameter for the initial memory size to initialization with.
\item {\ttfamily string(const string\&)} \+: Copy constructor\+: Creates a deep copy of a passed string.
\item {\ttfamily string(const char$\ast$)} \+: Constructor with parameter {\ttfamily const char$\ast$}.
\item {\ttfamily string(const std\+::string\&)} \+: Constructor with parameter std\+::string.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{Operators}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md4}
The following operators are implemented\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Operator + and += such that string, std\+::string and (const) char$\ast$ can be added
\item Assignment operator = such that string, std\+::string and (const) char$\ast$ can be assigned
\item Comparison operators == and != such that comparisons with {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classutil_1_1string}{util\+::string}}}, {\ttfamily std\+::string} and {\ttfamily (const) char$\ast$} are possible. With respect to the last two cases, {\ttfamily std\+::string} and {\ttfamily const char$\ast$} may both be LHS as well as RHS arguments.
\item operator \mbox{[}\mbox{]} to access individual characters of {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classutil_1_1string}{util\+::string}}} object.
\item Streaming operator \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<} to print {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classutil_1_1string}{util\+::string}}} to {\ttfamily std\+::cout}.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{Methods}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md5}
The following methods are implemented\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily clear()}\+: Clears your string object.

It erases the contents of the string, which becomes an empty string (with a length of 0 characters).
\item {\ttfamily substr(pos, length)}\+: Returns a substring object of type \mbox{\hyperlink{classutil_1_1string}{util\+::string}} which starts at pos. Parameter length specifies the amount of characters of the new {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classutil_1_1string}{util\+::string}}} to be returned.

The substring is the portion of the object that starts at character position start\+\_\+position and spans len characters (or until the end of the string, whichever comes first).
\item {\ttfamily length()}\+: Returns the amount of characters of your string excluding {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}0}. Might be smaller than the actual reserved memory.
\item {\ttfamily size()}\+: (synonyme to {\ttfamily length()}) Returns the amount of characters of your string excluding {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}0}. Might be smaller than the actual reserved memory.
\item {\ttfamily capacity()}\+: Returns the size of the storage space currently allocated for the string, expressed in terms of bytes.
\item {\ttfamily raw\+Size(const char$\ast$ raw\+Char)} \+: Get the amount of characters of a raw char$\ast$ string excluding the terminating {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}0}.
\item {\ttfamily c\+\_\+str()}\+: Allows raw access to the internal C-\/string respectively the {\ttfamily char$\ast$} pointer.

Returns a pointer to an array that contains a null-\/terminated sequence of characters (i.\+e., a C-\/string) representing the current value of the string object.
\item {\ttfamily intialize\+\_\+string(size\+\_\+t length = 0)} Ensure a string is initialized before using it. It initialize an empty string with buffer size of the given length.
\item {\ttfamily deep\+Copy(const char$\ast$ raw\+Char, size\+\_\+t start\+Position = 0)}\+: Deep copy of primitive C-\/string into the string internal buffer.

This function realizes a design and implementation of a concept to extend the internal memory if \mbox{\hyperlink{classutil_1_1string}{util\+::string}} has to store more than its current allocated buffer size.

Note that the function copy the passed char array starting from the start\+Position (i.\+e. it can write starting from any position in the internal string buffer) start\+Position default is 0
\item {\ttfamily compare(const char$\ast$ s1, const char$\ast$ s2)}\+: Compares two char $\ast$ strings lexicographically.

This function is my own implementation of the std\+::strcmp() function. Note this function performs a binary comparison of the ASCII code of the characters.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysection{Non-\/member Functions}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md6}
Some non-\/member utility functions are implemented that help for better functionality and output. These functions are\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily deep\+Copy(char$\ast$ raw\+Char\+Target, const char$\ast$ raw\+Char\+Source, size\+\_\+t dest\+Start\+Position, size\+\_\+t src\+End\+Position)} \+: Deep copy of primitive C-\/string into another primitive C-\/string. This function realizes a design and implementation of a concept to low-\/level copy and fill a primitive C-\/string with another primitive C-\/string starting from a given start position and with a desired number of character from the sourrce string.

Note that the function copy the passed char array starting from the start\+Position (i.\+e. it can write starting from any position in the destination string buffer) start\+Position default is 0
\item {\ttfamily print\+Header(const char$\ast$ text), print\+Sub\+Header(const char$\ast$ text), print\+Test\+Case(const char$\ast$ text)} \+: to print a nicely formatted and colored text header, sub header, title header, respectively to the terminal
